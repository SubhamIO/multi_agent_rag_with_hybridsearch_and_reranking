An il- lustration of attention patterns of these architectures is shown in Figure 4. Encoder Decoder: This architecture processes inputs through the encoder and passes the intermediate representation to the decoder to generate the output. Here, the encoder sees the complete sequence utilizing self-attention whereas the decoder processes the sequence one after the other with implementing cross-attention. Causal Decoder: A type of architecture that does not have an encoder and processes and generates output using a decoder, where the predicted token depends only on the previous time steps. Prefix Decoder: It is also known as a non-causal decoder, where the attention calculation is not strictly dependent on the past information and the attention is bidirectional. An example of a non-causal attention mask is shown in Figure 4. Mixture-of-Experts: It is a variant of transformer architecture with parallel independent experts and a router to route tokens to experts. These experts are feed-forward layers after the at- tention block [90]. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is an e fficient sparse architecture that offers comparable performance to dense models and allows increasing the model size without increas- ing the computational cost by activating only a few experts at a time [91, 92]. 2.10. Pre-Training Objectives This section describes LLMs pre-training objectives. For more details see the paper [93]. Full Language Modeling: An autoregressive language model- ing objective where the model is asked to predict future tokens given the previous tokens, an example is shown in Figure 5. Prefix Language Modeling: A non-causal training objective, where a prefix is chosen randomly and only remaining target tokens are used to calculate the loss. An example is shown in Figure 5. 5\n",

Positional Encoding: Like other building blocks of the model, positional encoding also a ffects the performance and training stability of LLMs. BLOOM [13] finds ALiBi outperforms learned and rotary positional encodings. Contrary to this, GLM-130B [33] identifies rotary positional encoding as being better than ALiBi. So, there is no conclusion in the literature about positional encodings yet. Parallel Attention: In this type of attention, feed-forward and attention layers are parallel to each other rather than sequen- tial in a transformer block. It has been shown to reduce train- ing time by 15%. There is no evidence of performance drop due to this change in the literature and it is used by the models PaLM [15], GPT-NeoX [118], and CodeGen [130].

Moreover, LLMs play a cru- cial role in data analysis, where they can filter large volumes of text data, summarize key points, and find patterns that would take humans much longer to identify [425]. Despite their wide- ranging applications, it is essential to remember that LLMs, similar to any AI system, are only as good as the data they have been trained on. Medicine: The application of LLMs in the field of medicine is reshaping healthcare delivery and research. For example, LLMs are increasingly used in clinical decision support systems to provide physicians with evidence-based treatment recommen- dations [426, 427, 428]. By analyzing patient data and medical literature, they can help identify potential diagnoses, suggest appropriate tests, and recommend optimal treatment strategies. Moreover, LLMs can also enhance patient interactions with healthcare systems; e.g., they can be used in chatbot applica- tions [429, 430, 431] to answer patient queries about symptoms or medications, schedule appointments, and even provide es- sential health advice. For medical research, LLMs are used to extract and filter information from a considerable amount of medical literature, identify relevant studies, summarize find- ings, and even predict future research trends [432, 433, 434]. For medical education, LLMs can help create training mate- rials, generate exam questions, provide detailed explanations of complex medical topics, and o ffer personalized feedback to students [435, 436, 437, 438]. They can also simulate patient interactions, enabling students to practice and improve their clinical skills. At a broader level, LLMs can assist in public health initiatives by analyzing media data to detect disease out- breaks, monitor public sentiment towards health policies, and disseminate health information in a clear and understandable manner [439]. LLMs can be employed to support public health initiatives, addressing related issues such as data privacy, the necessity for explainability, and the potential risk of propagat- ing biases [440, 441]. Education: The integration of LLMs into the educational sec- tor offers opportunities to enhance learning experiences, teacher 31\n",

      "make LLMs aware of the available low-level task operations. LLM (Say) builds a high-level plan to complete the task and a learned affordance function (Can) explores the possibility of executing the plan in the real world. SayCan uses RL to train the language-conditioned affordance function. PaLM-E enables the LLM to solve grounded tasks by training multi-modal LLM feeding inputs directly from the sensors. Manipulation: In the area of manipulation [226, 231], LLMs enhance a robot’s dexterity and adaptability, excelling in tasks like object recognition, grasping, and collaboration. They ana- lyze visual and spatial information to determine the most effec- tive approach to interact with objects. Navigation: LLMs enhance a robot’s ability to navigate com- plex environments with precision and adaptability [232, 233, 234, 235]. They generate feasible paths and trajectories for robots, accounting for intricate environmental details [236]. This ability is valuable in scenarios requiring precise and dynamically adaptable navigation in environments like ware- houses, transport, healthcare facilities, and residences. 3.6. E fficient LLMs Deploying LLMs in production is expensive. Reducing their running costs while preserving performance is an appealing area of research. This section summarizes the approaches sug- gested to enhance LLMs’ efficiency. 3.6.1. Parameter E fficient Fine-Tuning Fine-tuning LLMs with tens or hundreds of billions of pa- rameters, such as GPT-3 (175B), BLOOM (176B), MT-NLG (540B), etc., is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To avoid complete model fine-tuning, numerous parameter- efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques [40, 237, 41, 38, 39] try to achieve acceptable model fine-tuning performance at reduced costs. As compared to full fine-tuning [238], PEFT performs better in low-resource setups, achieves comparable perfor- mance on medium-resource scenarios, and performs worse than full fine-tuning under high-resource availability. An overview of different PEFT approaches is shown in Figure 14. Adapter Tuning: Adds a few trainable parameters within the transformer block. The adapter layer is a sequence of feature downscaling, non-linearity, and upscaling [106]. Variants of adapter tuning inject adapter layers sequentially [106] and in parallel [38], whereas the mixture of adapter (AdaMix) [239] employs multiple adapter modules in a single layer. AdaMix routes input instances randomly to one of the multiple down- scale and upscale modules. The mixture of adapters is averaged out for inference to avoid additional latency. Low-Rank Adap- tation (LoRA) [240] learns low-rank decomposed matrices to freeze original weights. The learned weights are fused with the original weights for inference, avoiding latency. Prompt Tuning: Prompting is an e ffective way to adapt a pre-trained LLM for the downstream task. However, manual prompts bring uncertainty in the model’s prediction, where a\n"

      "{'query': 'What is Attention mechanism?', 'context': '2. Background\\nWe provide the relevant background to understand the fun-\\ndamentals related to LLMs in this section. We briefly discuss\\nnecessary components in LLMs and refer the readers interested\\nin details to the original works.\\n2.1. Tokenization\\nTokenization [59] is an essential pre-processing step in\\nLLM training that parses the text into non-decomposing units\\ncalled tokens. Tokens can be characters, subwords [60], sym-\\nbols [61], or words, depending on the tokenization process.\\nSome of the commonly used tokenization schemes in LLMs\\ninclude wordpiece [62], byte pair encoding (BPE) [61], and un-\\nigramLM [60]. Readers are encouraged to refer to [63] for a\\ndetailed survey.\\n2.2. Encoding Positions\\nThe transformer processes input sequences in parallel and\\nindependently of each other. Moreover, the attention mod-\\nule in the transformer does not capture positional information.\\nAs a result, positional encodings were introduced in trans-\\nformer [64], where a positional embedding vector is added to\\nthe token embedding. Variants of positional embedding include\\nabsolute, relative, or learned positional encodings. Within rel-\\native encoding, Alibi and RoPE are two widely used positional\\nembeddings in LLMs.\\nAlibi [65]: It subtracts a scalar bias from the attention score\\nthat increases with the distance between token positions. This\\nfavors using recent tokens for attention.\\nRoPE [66]: It rotates query and key representations at an an-\\ngle proportional to the token absolute position in the input\\nsequence, resulting in a relative positional encoding scheme\\nwhich decays with the distance between the tokens.\\n2.3. Attention in LLMs\\nAttention assigns weights to input tokens based on impor-\\ntance so that the model gives more emphasis to relevant tokens.\\nAttention in transformers [64] calculates query, key, and value\\nmappings for input sequences, where the attention score is\\nobtained by multiplying the query and key, and later used to\\nweight values. We discuss different attention strategies used in\\nLLMs below.\\nSelf-Attention [64]: Calculates attention using queries, keys,\\nand values from the same block (encoder or decoder).\\nCross Attention: It is used in encoder-decoder architectures,\\nwhere encoder outputs are the queries, and key-value pairs\\ncome from the decoder.\\nSparse Attention [67]: Self-attention has O(n2) time complex-\\nity which becomes infeasible for large sequences. To speed\\nup the computation, sparse attention [67] iteratively calculates\\nattention in sliding windows for speed gains.\\nFlash Attention [68]: Memory access is the major bottleneck\\nin calculating attention using GPUs. To speed up, flash\\nattention employs input tiling to minimize the memory reads\\nand writes between the GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM)\\nand the on-chip SRAM.\\n2.4. Activation Functions\\nThe activation functions serve a crucial role in the curve-\\nfitting abilities of neural networks [69]. We discuss activation\\nfunctions used in LLMs in this section.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAttention Visualizations\\nInput-Input Layer5\\nIt\\nis\\nin\\nthis\\nspirit\\nthat\\na\\nmajority\\nof\\nAmerican\\ngovernments\\nhave\\npassed\\nnew\\nlaws\\nsince\\n2009\\nmaking\\nthe\\nregistration\\nor\\nvoting\\nprocess\\nmore\\ndifficult\\n.\\n<EOS>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\nIt\\nis\\nin\\nthis\\nspirit\\nthat\\na\\nmajority\\nof\\nAmerican\\ngovernments\\nhave\\npassed\\nnew\\nlaws\\nsince\\n2009\\nmaking\\nthe\\nregistration\\nor\\nvoting\\nprocess\\nmore\\ndifficult\\n.\\n<EOS>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\n<pad>\\nFigure 3: An example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the\\nencoder self-attention in layer 5 of 6.

These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ...,headh)WO\\nwhere headi = Attention(QWQ\\ni , KWK\\ni , V WV\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matricesWQ\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk , WK\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk , WV\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dv\\nand WO ∈ Rhdv×dmodel .\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\n\\n---\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35, 2, 5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\n\\n---\\n\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'}\n",
